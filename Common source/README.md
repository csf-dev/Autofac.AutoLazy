This directory contains source files which are used in
both of the following projects.

* `AutoLazy.Autofac4`
* `AutoLazy.Autofac5`

There is only **one** of each source file (the one in this
directory) but they are *linked* to both projects noted above.

Compiler flags are used to differentiate between the (small)
differences required in order to deal with the two Autofac
major versions which are supported.
