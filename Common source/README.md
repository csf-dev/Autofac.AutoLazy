This directory contains source files which are used in both:

* Autofac.AutoLazy4
* Autofac.AutoLazy5

There is only one copy of each source file (the one in this
directory) but they are *linked* to both projects noted above.

Compiler flags are used to differentiate between the (small)
differences required in order to deal with the two Autofac
major versions.
